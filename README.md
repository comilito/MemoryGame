# MemoryGame
I will be honest with you guys - i got a bit help from my friend, I'm yet learning C# and I'm in the middle of Masterclass at Udemy 
(haven't coded in C# yet - only C++ but years ago)
but you replied instantly to my application and i don't want to lose a chance since this entire Motorola Course is great for beginners. 
Hope that you'll give me chance despite that. Thank You.
